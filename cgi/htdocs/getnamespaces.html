    <p>Namespaces define a container within a CIM&nbsp; Server for Classes and
    Instances. There may be multiple namespaces in a single CIM Server.&nbsp;
    While Namespaces names are defined in a manner that makes them look
    hiearchial (/root/cimv2), in fact, they are simply a list of names in the
    Pegasus implementation.&nbsp; The CIM specifications leave the defintion of
    namespace relationships as an implementation issue and we chose to simply
    make them a flat name list.&nbsp; Thus root is a single namespace and
    root/cimv2 is a single namespace but there is no implied relationship
    between root and root/cimv2.&nbsp; There is no inheritance of
    characteristics or classes and no issues of containment.</p>
    <p>However, the concept of namespaces is key to understanding CIM
    operations.&nbsp; All operations are executed against a namespace.&nbsp; You
    will note that the name of the namespace exists in the form screen for all
    operations.&nbsp; This is a required field for every CIM operation.</p>
    <p>In fact, the only relationships that really exist across namespaces are
    those defined by associations.</p>
    <p>Only one namespace is clearly defined and required by the CIM
    specificaitons, root.&nbsp; All other namespaces including cimv2 are merely
    recommendations or examples today.</p>
    <p>Normally namespaces are defined and populated as part of the process of
    installing CIM classes. The capability exists to create and to delete
    namespaces.</p>
    <p>These functions are provided in this demonstration simply as a tool to
    help you understand what namespaces are and how we access them.</p>
    <p>There are today two different techniques for querying an manipulating
    namespaces.</p>
    <h3>Original Namespace Manipulator</h3>
    <p>The original technique defined in the CIM Operations document V1 is based
    on the use of a pseudo class __Namespace and execution of operations on the
    instances of this pseudo class (enumerate instances, create instance, delete
    instance) to query namespaces and to create and delete namespaces.&nbsp; We
    call this a pseudo class because it does not really exist in the CIM
    schemas.&nbsp; It is implementation dependent and may be defined differently
    for each implementation.</p>
    <p>In fact, since the properities of this class are implementation dependent
    there is really no interoperability in the manipulation of namespaces.</p>
    <h3>New Namespace Manipulator</h3>
    <p>Effective with CIM 2.6, a new set of classes has been defined for the
    query of information about CIM Servers and the namespaces defined in those
    CIM servers.</p>
    <p>TBD</p>
