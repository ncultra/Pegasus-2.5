// Description: The Network Model extends the management concepts to
//              represent protocol interfaces and network/protocol
//              services.  This file provides the definitions for
//              Link Aggregation based on the IEEE 802.3ad
//              specification.
//              The IEEE specification should be consulted to understand
//              the proper use and value assignment of the
//              link aggregation properties.
// 
//              The object classes below are listed in an order that
//              avoids forward references. Required objects, defined
//              by other working groups, are omitted.

// Change Log for v2.9 Preliminary -
