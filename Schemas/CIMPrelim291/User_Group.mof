//              This file defines the concepts and classes related to

// 
//              The object classes below are listed in an order that
//              avoids forward references. Required objects, defined

// Change Log for v2.9:
// CR1501 - Create AccountGroup and define relationship to
//          ChangeAccess, ShowAccess, Roles, and AuthorizationPolicy
// CR1515 - Clarify intended use for LDAP, not general
// 
// Change Log for v2.8: None
// 
// Change Log for v2.7
// (ERRATA) CR855 - Changed cardinality of the Antecedent from 0..1
//         to 1 for MoreGroupInfo

       "The AccountGroup class is used to collect Accounts into "

       "Identity aspect, which is associated via ConcreteIdentity. "
       "This Identity MAY be used in all places where any other "
       "Identity MAY be used. In particular, it MAY be used with the "
       "ShowAccess and ChangeAccess methods of the "
       "PrivilegeMangementService and it MAY be aggregated into a Role "
       "via MemberOfCollection and it MAY be associated to "
       "AuthorizationRule by AuthorizationRuleAppliesToIdentity and to "
       "AuthenticationRule by PolicySetAppliesToElement. In all of "
       "these cases, Privileges extended to the Identity of the "
       "AccountGroup are extended to the Identities associated with "
       "the collected Account instances.")]

          "Within the scope of the instantiating Namespace, InstanceID "
          "opaquely and uniquely identifies an instance of this class. "
          "In order to ensure uniqueness within the NameSpace, the "
          "value of InstanceID SHOULD be constructed using the "
          "following 'preferred' algorithm: \n"
          "<OrgID>:<LocalID> \n"
          "Where <OrgID> and <LocalID> are separated by a colon ':', "
          "and where <OrgID> MUST include a copyrighted, trademarked "
          "or otherwise unique name that is owned by the business "
          "entity creating/defining the InstanceID, or is a registered "
          "ID that is assigned to the business entity by a recognized "
          "global authority (This is similar to the <Schema "
          "Name>_<Class Name> structure of Schema class names.) In "
          "addition, to ensure uniqueness <OrgID> MUST NOT contain a "
          "colon (':'). When using this algorithm, the first colon to "
          "appear in InstanceID MUST appear between <OrgID> and "
          "<LocalID>. \n"
          "<LocalID> is chosen by the business entity and SHOULD not "
          "be re-used to identify different underlying (real-world) "
          "elements. If the above 'preferred' algorithm is not used, "
          "the defining entity MUST assure that the resultant "
          "InstanceID is not re-used across any InstanceIDs produced "
          "by this or other providers for this instance's NameSpace. \n"
