// Description: This class represents a component of the SW resource
//      model defined in the application_SWResources.mof schema.
//      This class is included as a separate component in the
//      database model because it references the database model
//      and should not exist unless the database model is installed.
//      The class defines the association to connect a SWResource aspect
//      of the SWResources model to a database.
// 
//      The object classes below are listed in an order that
//      avoids forward references. Required objects, defined
//      by other working groups, are omitted.
