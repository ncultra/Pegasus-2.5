// Description:
//       The database model provides a set of classes and
//       associations for managing database systems.
// 
//       This MOF describes a three level model for a database
//       environment.
//          1) The database system software that has been deployed
//          2) The common database entity and associated storage
//          3) The database runtime services which perform tasks for the
//             database, such as coordinating user access
// 
//       The classes and associations provided in this model are
//       intended to be common across all database organizations
//       and vendor implementations.  The database model
//       represents the entities, associations, and properties that
//       at an abstract level are appropriate for all database
//       organizations and vendor implementations.  For readability
//       purposes, the term database when used in this MOF refers to
//       the common database entity.
// 
//       The object classes below are listed in an order that
//       avoids forward references. Required objects that have been
//       defined by other working groups are omitted.
// 
//       The includes are listed in an order that avoids forward
//       references.  Dependent classes or associations that are
//       part of other models have been omitted.
