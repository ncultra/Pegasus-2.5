OVERVIEW
========

This utility emulates on NT the CDPATH behavior of the Unix C-Shell. Its use
is trivial:

    1.	Copy jdath.exe and jd.bat to a directory on your path.

    2.	Set your JDPATH as you would on Unix (except use semicolons to
    	delimit rather than colons).

    3.	Set your HOME environment variable (used when jd is invoked without
	arguments).

    4.	Use jd to change to directories on the path. For example,

	    C:\> jd fred

    5.	You may change back to the previous directory with:

	    C:\> jd -

It is now possible to make an alias for the current directory as follows:

    C:\> jd -a zz

This saves the current working directory path in a file called:

    C:\jdalias\zz

You may later return to that directory as follows:

    C:\> jd zz

The JDPATH is used before checking an aliases.

LIMITATIONS
===========

    "jd -" doesn't work immediately after another "jd -" was typed.

BUILDING JDPATH.EXE
===================

    C:\> nmake -f makefile.nt

That's all!
