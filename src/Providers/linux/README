This directory contains providers for the Pegasus wbem project.  The
important directories in this directory are:

ProviderData - The core classes for the provider functionality.
		ProviderData classes contain all the functionality of
		the providers and the code implementing the 
		CIMInstanceProvider API is only a small layer between 
		the API and the ProviderData class.

ProviderSupport - Classes used by ProviderData to carry out their
		functionality.  This includes file parsing routines, 
		bus walking code and other generic support for use by 
		all ProviderData classes.  Not all ProviderData classes 
		use ProviderSupport classes.
