SOURCE CODE ORGANIZATION
==========================

The source code is organized as follows:

Initial directory = ldap_slp
+---conf                     <-- contains the DA configuration file 
+---doc                      <-- contains some internet-drafts
+---scripts		     <-- shell scripts that demonstrate functions
+---src                      <-- source code
|   +---cmd-utils            <-- command-line utilities
|   |   +---slp_client       <-- slp client library
|   |   +---slp_query        <-- command-line slp user agent 
|   |   +---slp_srvreg       <-- command-line and daemon slp service agent


BUILD REQUIREMENTS
===========================

To build the source tree, you must have Bash, Gnu Make, Gnu Autoconf,
and Gnu Libtool, and a C compiler and linker. 

Information on downloading, installing, and using Autoconf and Libtool
is in the file README.AUTOCONF. 


COPYING GNU SHELL SCRIPTS TO BULD DIRECTORY
============================================

There are four shell scripts that you may need to copy to the build
directory in order for the build to be successful. These scripts are
generated and installed as part of the Autoconf and Libtool
installation procedures (see README.AUTOCONF). 


1) config.guess

This shell script determines the build platform. It will be
located in one of the libtool directories, but will probably be
located in multiple directores on your system if you have done a lot
of building products from source (as opposed to RPM packages). Here is
how I copied it on my RedHat 7.3 system: 

cp /usr/share/libtool/config.guess $PEGASUS_ROOT/src/Unsupported/slp_client/

2) config.sub

This shell script contains subroutines used by Autoconf. Here is now I
copied it on my RedHat 7.3 system:

cp /usr/share/automake-1.5/config.sub $PEGASUS_ROOT/src/Unsupported/slp_client/

3) install-sh

This shell script performs library installation for Libtool. Here is
how I copied it on my RedHat 7.3 system:

cp /usr/share/automake-1.5/install-sh $PEGASUS_ROOT/src/Unsupported/slp_client/


4) ltmain.sh

This is a template for generating the libtool script for your specific
platform. Here is how I copied it on my RedHat 7.3 system:


cp /usr/share/libtool/ltmain.sh $PEGASUS_ROOT/src/Unsupported/slp_client/


BUILD COMMANDS
===========================

1) Untar distribution tarball and cd into the slp_client directory. 
2) type ./configure <Enter>
3) type make <Enter>

Binaries will be located in the same directories as thier source. The
mysterious machinations of libtool allow you to link and run binaries
against the libslp_client.so shared library without actually
installing anything. 

To clean all the binaries, type make clean <Enter>


INSTALLATION
===========================

To install, su to root and type make install <Enter>
