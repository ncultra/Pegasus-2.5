This directory provides a simple (C)ommand (L)ine (I)nterface to the
WQL parser for seeing how certain queries are processed.

Note that this function will return passed for any legal WQL since the
environment sets up a specific set of conditions for the variables before running the
WQL and that set of conditions must be matched by the WQL statement being
tested.
