ParserTestProvider Module
--------------------------
This test case tries to exercise the XML parser/generator code of the pegasus
CIMOM.
- The test provider implemented here uses a malformed string (with trailing
NULLS, trailing spaces and other illegal characters) inside the provider
methods.
- The XML output should not be affected by any of these illegal strings that
are manipulated by the provider.
