Large Data Sample Provider
--------------------------
The test programs present in this directory implement an instance provider 
that exercise the messaging system by returning large amounts of data.

The Base Class of the provider is LargeDataSampleClass, the class for which
all the CIM operations are performed is SampleClass.

Working
-------
There is a const macro NO_OF_INSTANCES which decides the number of instances 
to be created. This can be modified for testing huge amount of data in any of 
the 2 places. Either in the source file LargeDataProvider.cpp Or in the 
Makefile by defining the NO_OF_INSTANCES locally as:
LOCAL_DEFINES=-DNO_OF_INSTANCES=<number>
If it is defined inside the Makefile, the value present in the cpp source is 
overwritten.
The creation of Instances is done when the enumerateInstances method of the
provider is called.If a client requests for enumerateInstanceNames it will fail
if enumerateInstances wouldn't have been executed.

Scripts
-------
rebuild: After modifying the source for NO_OF_INSTANCES you need to execute 
	this script in order to rebuild and register the provider. It also 
	restarts the cimserver so that the new repository is also loaded when
	we are performing operations on the Provider.
