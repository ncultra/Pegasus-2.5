<mdday> yes - I'm on a phone call right now but I found an uninitialized cimom handle and fixed it. 
<mdday> I've amost got the cimop dispatcher to work asyncrhonously and we can use that as a template for getting the other services working.

<mdday> Roger are you on the call?
<mdday> oops - 1pm CENTRAL. dang. 
<kumpf> Right.  That threw me at first, too.
<mdday> Karl's email said "13:00" est
<kumpf> It said "est" in the subject, and CENTRAL in the body.
<mdday> Karl's "multitasking"
<kumpf> I think he "multitasks" a lot.
<mdday> He's a "multitasking" machine

<NIU> Mike... I know you are on call, but a question...?
<mdday> not any more, go ahead
<NIU> Do we need to change enqueue and handleEnqueue calls to SendWait in files like OpDispatcher, ExportDispatcher, IndicationService, Handler...?
<NIU> or still we will be using handleEnqueue and queue->enqueue?
<mdday> we're virtualizing enqueue, dequeue, and handleEnqueue to do that automatically. in MessageQueueService and derived classes we will have an intelligent version of these methods
<NIU> Or all these services will communicate to meta-dispatcher with old fashion.
<mdday> that will recognize messages that have an envelope. We put a protected backpointer in the Message class to refer to the AsyncLegacy envelope. 
<NIU> See UID 97 and 99. Will they also change? I don't see any reason to change.
<NIU> How can I pass a request from one service to another? Who will take care of it? How will get target queue id?
<mdday> This will get the cimom working today or tommorow (hopefully) without very many changes. Specifically, we won't need to change all the existing message handlers. 
<mdday> I will have the cimop dispatcher as an example later today.

* kumpf is back (gone 01:49:09)
<kumpf> Mike, bring it on!  Give me the word, and I'll pull down the bits and try them out.
<mdday> Roger - I just ran test client to completion. I will check it in. 
<kumpf> Wow, you are amazing!
<kumpf> Should I pull it down now?
<mdday> It's checked in. Here's the scoop. I built and ran it on linux with tracing enabled. It uses SendWait in when communicating with the configuration manager queue. 
<mdday> everything works, the testclient runs just fine. I hope you can build it on windows. also, I have not tested it with no tracing, which is interesting because it changes the timing. 
<mdday> Yes, pull it down !
<kumpf> Okay, it's going.
<mdday> good luck - I'm late !
<kumpf> Take off if you need to.  I'll report back on the results.  Thanks for doing all this!
<mdday> ok - I just ran it twice with no tracing and it works just fine. later

<kumpf> Are we having trouble staying connected?
<cvincent> My client is flaky
<kumpf> Mike's isn't all that consistent either.  How do you proxy your connection?
<-- cvincent has quit (Remote closed the connection)
--> cvincent (~cvincent@129.33.49.201) has joined #pegasus
<cvincent> I'm using socks 5
<kumpf> Have you tried using an HTTP proxy?
<cvincent> Not yet, but we have one so I will try.
<kumpf> It's worked great for me.

--> cvincent (~cvincent@129.33.49.201) has joined #pegasus
<cvincent> I'm not trying the proxy... we'll see.
<cvincent> I mean I AM using the proxy
<kumpf> Looks good so far.
<cvincent> FYI, I'm working on the provider entry point change and testing the provider registration.
<kumpf> Sounds good.  We changed a bunch of providers, and will check them in when you put that change in.
<cvincent> I'll let you know when I'm done.
<kumpf> Great, thanks.

<mdday> I'm baaaaaack  !!!
<mdday> Chip are you using the http proxy?
<-- cvincent has quit (Remote closed the connection)
<mdday> I guess not!
<mdday> our socks server closes the connection if there is no activity for ~ 40 seconds or so. 
<kumpf> Chip said he was using the HTTP proxy, and it seemed to be working for a while.

<cvincent> Okay, the raleigh proxy is flaky

<mdday> we'll see !
