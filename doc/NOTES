Notes from San Jose Meeting (February 8 - 9, 2001):
===================================================

Ideas:

    *	Write "The Pegasus Data Object" paper.

    *	Tony might be able to help with GUI (will talk
	to Management).

    *	Use MOF compiler to generate CreateInstance()
        functions.

    *	See about porting to Tandem (see if BMC has a
	Tandem box).

    *	Take a look at HTTPerf for beautiful code.

    *	Implement process provider.

    *	Take a look at UDG (Unix Design Guide); It proposed
	common Unix OS intrumentation.

    * 	What about dynmaic invocation of MOF?

    *	Can we remove ACE earlier than planned?

    *	Enumerate for Comapaq what level-1 SQL involves.

    *	Client authentication.

    *	We need a Java client.

    *	Perform interoperability testing between "Sun WBEM
	Services" client and Pegasus server.

    *	Need a whole Java discussion.

    *	Provider writer's guide (start from writing provider,
	compiling MOF, and accessing it from a client).

    *	DevCon: Paris in April.

    *	DevCon: San Jose in June.

    *	Compaq may contribute providers.

    *	Installation using Install Shield.

Compaq Priorities:

    *	Get ACE going on Tandem.

    *	Finalizing provider interface.

    *	Query (Need SQL Parser).
