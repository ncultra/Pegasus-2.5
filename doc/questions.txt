    1.	May associations span namespaces? And if so, how can one
	make sense of references referring to object names with no
	namespace. And since the CIM operation specifies a target
	namespace anyhow, what is the target namespace for? Is it 
	the namespace to place the new association in on a 
	createInstance().

	If associations can span namespaces, should the association name
	in the association file contain a namespace?
