Ported to what?
===============

We ported to a platform using the DEC C++ compiler (whose program name
is cxx). Here is what "uname -a" had to say about our platform):

% uname -a 
OSF1 hodtbd01.bmc.com V4.0 1229 alpha

Notes on building for TRU64:
============================

1.  Define these environment variables:

    PEGASUS_PLATFORM <- TRU64_ALPHA_DECCXX
    PEGASUS_OS_TYPE <- unix
    PEGASUS_HOME <- $HOME/pegasus_home

2.  Be sure GNU make is on your path before the ordinary make (name it
    "make").

3.  Make an install mu (only necessary to get proper source dependencies
    working). Just change to peagsus/src/utils/mu and type "make". Then
    install it (put mu executable on your path someplace).

4.  Install flex and bison (you can also change the makefiles to use lex
    and yacc).

5.  Be sure to put PEGASUS_HOME/bin on your PATH

6.  Be sure to put PEGASUS_HOME/lib on your LD_LIBRARY_PATH

7.  If this fails, e-mail mbrasher@bmc.com

Unresolved problems:
====================

1.  Template instantiation is done locally (using the -tlocal option) so
    binaries will be a bit larger for now. The largest library is around
    600K at present (this is expected to shrink later).

2.  Some unreachable code warnings exist in code generated by bison
    (we can't do anything about these unfortunately but they are harmless).

3.  There is a harmless warning from the file <sys/select.h> (not much we
    can do about this one).
